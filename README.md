Draft notebooks for review paper on PTHA

Open the notebook [Contents.ipynb](Contents.ipynb) 
for the suggested order to view the other notebooks.

### View on Github

You can view static versions of the notebooks on the Github page by clicking
on a notebook in the list of files.  Note that the interactive widgets do not
work if you view them this way.

### Run the notebooks

To get the most out of the illustrations, you must run the notebooks, either
by cloning this repository and using a Jupyter server on your computer (see
the [Jupyter documentation](http://jupyter.org/), or by running on the
cloud.

### Run on binder

You can use [binder](http://mybinder.org) to launch a notebook server in the
cloud from which you can run these notebooks from any web browser without
installing anything.  This may be slow to launch if binder is in heavy use:
